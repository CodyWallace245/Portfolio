TIR Sports / TIR Targets is a project that has been on my mind for almost 3 years. In sports, and Lacrosse specifically, there are only a few ways to improve, and often that means repeating the same task. In lacrosse, that task is "Wall ball" where the user takes their lacrosse stick and goes to a wall and tries to throw the ball at the same point repeatedly. There's no indicator of success, just a feeling/rythm you get into where the ball always hits the same spot. This works really well, until you need to start practicing your shot.

TIR Targets were designed to really address a need. In wall ball, you choose a single location and shoot at it, but you can't use a wall when you're throwing the ball as hard as you can, because well... it comes back at you just as fast. When you move to the net, there's no easy way to choose a spot to hit, all the diamonds look the same and visually you can't differentiate them. There are other products in the market that provide visual cues, but they're all limited to attaching to the structural poles of the net and when you hit them, there is limited feedback provided to let you know you hit them sufficiently. Also, they're terribly hard for younger kids to setup - even as an adult i struggled to assemble some of the targets to the net.

TIR Targets were designed to catch your eye, be easily placed anywhere in or on the net, and provide sufficient feedback to let you know you really hit the mark.

This project started with simple designs that in retrospect, look quite awful - but hey you start somewhere.
