TIR Sports / TIR Targets is a project that has been on my mind for almost 3 years. In sports, and Lacrosse specifically, there are only a few ways to improve, and often that means repeating the same task. In lacrosse, that task is "Wall ball" where the user takes their lacrosse stick and goes to a wall and tries to throw the ball at the same point repeatedly. There's no indicator of success, just a feeling/rythm you get into where the ball always hits the same spot. This works really well, until you need to start practicing your shot.

TIR Targets were designed to really address a need. In wall ball, you choose a single location and shoot at it, but you can't use a wall when you're throwing the ball as hard as you can, because well... it comes back at you just as fast. When you move to the net, there's no easy way to choose a spot to hit, all the diamonds look the same and visually you can't differentiate them. There are other products in the market that provide visual cues, but they're all limited to attaching to the structural poles of the net and when you hit them, there is limited feedback provided to let you know you hit them sufficiently. Also, they're terribly hard for younger kids to setup - even as an adult i struggled to assemble some of the targets to the net.

TIR Targets were designed to catch your eye, be easily placed anywhere in or on the net, and provide sufficient feedback to let you know you really hit the mark.

## Iteration 1

This project started with simple designs that, in retrospect, look quite awful - but hey you start somewhere.

As I iterated on the targets, I wanted to make something that was well-built, but also allowed me to add bells or attachments to the target. I experimented with 45 degree holes that would require inserts into the mold, this would allow me to clip chains into the holes and the chains would rattle like a basketball net.

This just wasn't professional enough and it really didnt make enough sound.

## Iteration 2

Iteration 2 really started to focus on making something that allowed attachments, but realistically, these holes were way too small, and they still required 8 pins to be inserted into the mold, then removed before the mold could open. This just wasn't going to work, but the idea was getting more defined.

## Iteration 3

I began to look for different ways to make through-holes in products, I came across some manufacturing videos on injection molded plastic components.

![Shutoffs 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Shutoffs 2.jpg)

To produce through holes in this manner is called "shutoffs". Essentially, the material, once injected, flows over the top of a single pillar, but not around the sides, and once that pillar is removed there is a perpendicular hole. This is exactly what I wanted to produce. This way the target would have perpendicular holes that allowed me to attach or remove a wire or elastic. I was a bit skeptical, this works for injection molded plastic, but how would I form these at home? I had to get creative...

There had to be a break point near the center of the target, to allow a large portion of the target to be free once it had hardened and i removed one half, but the shutoffs had to pass entirely through the mold. If they didnt, then there would be leakage and the perpendicular holes wouldnt form properly, so both halves needed to be modified to fit each other, while also have separate separation points.

The image above shows the bottom portion of the mold, which has these pillars that the material flows over the top, but not the sides.

![Circle Mold]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Circlemoldshutoffstop.jpg)

The image above shows the top portion of the mold, which has holes that fit the shutoffs exactly and a little extra space over the top of the holes to allow material to flow over it.

And then - here we are. a real shutoff, too bad the material was ridiculously soft and the shutoffs are way too close to the strap connection points and they're also a little thin. also, look at those bubbles - I really need to find a way to get the air out of my mold.

## Iteration 4

![Iteration 4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/vids/ezgif.com-gif-maker (9).gif)

Time to get back to designing, It was now time to address the bubbles and thickness of the shutoffs. Also, the last mold was ridiculously hard to separate, maybe there is some alternative way to gain leverage and separate them.

![Circle Mold Vents]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Circlemoldwventsbot.jpg)

The above image shows the bottom of the mold, it's definitely an improvement. the shutoffs contour the cosmetic dip in the front of the target, and they're much thicker now. it's almost exactly 12" in diameter, which makes purchasing a wire easier, there are some 45 degree holes on the backside, which allows the mold to be pulled apart with string (this didn't work the way i expected) - overall a solid improvement.

![Circle Mold Vents]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Circlemoldwventstop.jpg)

The above image shows the top of the mold vent holes were added to the sides and vent holes were added to the tops of the shutoffs - that way i could use a syringe and inject material through those holes and really verify that there weren't as many holes where there needed to be structural stability for testing.

And now - the target is starting to look a lot better. The shutoffs are appropriately sized, only one of the shutoffs has a major air hole, and overall air flow improved. still though - there's room for improvement.

## Iteration 5

It's time to fix this up - a big redesign began, altering the number of strapping holes created a more streamlined user workflow. 3 straps are all that are required to hold the target snugly to a fix point, so remove 5 holes, put them all in a line so that the user has clear indication of how to use and place the target. shutoffs are placed appropriately contouring the cosmetic divot, cosmetic divots were added to the outside of the target contouring its new shape and a full concentric circle was added to pay homage to the dartboard target style we all know and think of when you say "target".

The mold began to improve drastically, ejector pin holes were added to the bottom portion of the mold, and hand grips were added as well. That way, when the mold is being separated, I have something to hold onto and press into the table.

## Production?

The target had finally made it to a stage where I felt like it embodied the goal. A target that can hang anywhere, when it gets hit bells will rattle and it's not terribly hard to setup. It's time to go to production... right?

I wasn't sure the right material, Silicone meets the hot and cold temperature needs - if I want to sell these targets to hockey players the target needs to not degrade severely around 32 degrees F and if a lacrosse player wants to use them in the summer on the turf, 110 degrees F is a likely scenario. But then again, a lacrosse ball moving at 85mph may destroy silicone...

I started thinking of some other products that are used year round and landed on Frisbee golf discs, these things hit trees at >85mph, they're used year round and they're usually pretty durable. What about getting some detailing onto the targets? I could go the traditional frolf route and foil stamp them maybe? But they're divots, foil stamps are usually performed on perfectly flat surfaces.

I talked with an overseas frolf manufacturer and floated the idea by them, they provided me some insight into materials and even sent me some samples, I responded as soon as I got the samples and which material was the best, but then didnt hear from them again. 30 Days later I let them know i was going with a Silicone manufacturer and man he wasn't pleased. I'm glad I did though, as I had been talking with this silicone manufacturer for nearly 3 months and they helped me better understand injection molding and what options were available to get the product made.  More importantly, they were punctual and professional - I'd get at least one response per day and they always answered my questions.

Before really getting into the negotiation, I used the protolabs part optimizer to check the manufacturability. I figured if they can simulate plastic parts being injection molded, it would be similar or the same to silicone. It turned out, I was 5-6mm too thick, the inside of the target would be difficult to harden and my ejection angles were off. Overall - it received a 7/100 on the manufacturability scale. I simply took 5mm out of the center of the target, re-worked all my angled components to flow nicely and rechecked. This time, 96/100 manufacturability. I was in business.

## Sample Mold

$600 was all it cost to get the single shot mold created. it took about 2 weeks for the mold to get made, and cost roughly $50 per sample. We started to work on some of the issues - getting the artwork onto the target required two separate steps. Drip dyeing and screen printing. Screen printing was pretty easy, but drip dying presented an issue. The center circle where the shutoffs passed through leaked dye, so we needed to adjust the mold. fortunately, it was a simple fix - create lines that added to the part, these would create small dams where the drip dye could rest until the liquid evaporated. 

![Final Mold]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Screen-print-drip-dye.jpg)

Phew - we made it, I was nervous I'd need an entirely new mold, thankfully the fix was simple and the work I put in to make my own molds at home was paying off.

Parts were decent quality, there were machine marks, bubbles in the drip dye and the the screen print had ejector pin marks. Still, good enough to move forward.

## Production Mold

$1900 more and the mold was complete - a four shot mold was created and we were off to production. Another set of samples was sent and overall quality improved. The drip dyeing was substantially improved, what was previously 20-30 bubbles in the drip dye, was now 1 or 2. The machine marks were gone on the outside and the ejector pin marks were nearly non-existent. I was elated. This was such a huge improvement and now I could start really testing the product.

## Beta Testers

I had been testing the sample targets for a while, they seemed to hold up well and everything was going smoothly. Then, one day, I was doing some distance training with my dog - 50-60 feet from the dog park in a little courtyard with a couple offices nearby. One of those offices happens to be a physical trainers office and a man in a wheelchair comes out with one leg elevated. He comes over to say hi to our pup and I notice he's wearing a lacrosse windbreaker. We get to talking and it turns out he's a Major League Lacrosse player, if this isn't the stars aligning i'm not sure what is. I send him some samples a couple weeks later and he likes them, one problem... the targets are breaking in the corners. This is not good news - but at least I haven't started selling the targets yet. I begin to scramble for solutions, I've already purchased custom straps - nearly 7000 of them ($4000 worth).

## Iteration 6

![Straps]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/IMG_1483.jpg)

I got to heavy testing - I setup the targets with a friend of mine and we just absolutely smashed the targets. Sure enough - they were all broken by the end of it. They all had the same failure mode - Cracks in the upper corners.

![Broken Target]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/IMG_1475.jpg)

I needed a solution - I experimented with the idea of a spreader bar (not that kind) often used in crane technology to disperse load on objects that have multiple contact points. I 3D printed some bars with 6 holes, and bought some elastic straps off Amazon to test the solution.

![Full Assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/strapsbarelastictarget.jpg)

This worked! No matter how hard we hit the target, the elastic bands were dispersing the force onto the bar, the targets were resting evenly as long as i adjusted the straps appropriately and overall it worked. Here's the issue - the bars made in aluminum were nearly ~$1.50 each in bulk, the straps were going to be ~$0.12 each in bulk, and importing metal was going to be expensive. I needed to relook at the solution, this wasn't going to be cost effective.

I really started to question my decisions when I realized that the rigid straps I purchased were the culprit. If there's one key takeaway from this project, it's that Minimum Viable Product (MVP) doesn't mesh with custom accessories. I recognized that if I removed the custom cam straps and the spreader bar - I was left with a silicone target and elastic unadjustable straps. This addressed a few issues and put solid limitations on the product that removed variability from how the user would setup the target.

The force of the hit didnt need to be disipated onto a spreader bar, when it could just be put on the crossbars, net, fence or whatever other object the target was strapped to. This change also removed the variability from users - the cam straps had ~18" of strap and an adjustable cam lock to work with, but now they had 4 inches of elastic strap and velcro that only fits together in one location. This meant that the targets were going to be evenly distributed across the straps almost exclusively, whereas someone could make ~16" of variability from strap to strap.
