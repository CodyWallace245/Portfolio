TIR Sports / TIR Targets is a project that has been on my mind for almost 3 years. In sports, and Lacrosse specifically, there are only a few ways to improve, and often that means repeating the same task. In lacrosse, that task is "Wall ball" where the user takes their lacrosse stick and goes to a wall and tries to throw the ball at the same point repeatedly. There's no indicator of success, just a feeling/rythm you get into where the ball always hits the same spot. This works really well, until you need to start practicing your shot.

TIR Targets were designed to really address a need. In wall ball, you choose a single location and shoot at it, but you can't use a wall when you're throwing the ball as hard as you can, because well... it comes back at you just as fast. When you move to the net, there's no easy way to choose a spot to hit, all the diamonds look the same and visually you can't differentiate them. There are other products in the market that provide visual cues, but they're all limited to attaching to the structural poles of the net and when you hit them, there is limited feedback provided to let you know you hit them sufficiently. Also, they're terribly hard for younger kids to setup - even as an adult i struggled to assemble some of the targets to the net.

TIR Targets were designed to catch your eye, be easily placed anywhere in or on the net, and provide sufficient feedback to let you know you really hit the mark.

## Iteration 1

This project started with simple designs that, in retrospect, look quite awful - but hey you start somewhere.

As I iterated on the targets, I wanted to make something that was well-built, but also allowed me to add bells or attachments to the target. I experimented with 45 degree holes that would require inserts into the mold, this would allow me to clip chains into the holes and the chains would rattle like a basketball net.

This just wasn't professional enough and it really didnt make enough sound.

## Iteration 2

Iteration 2 really started to focus on making something that allowed attachments, but realistically, these holes were way too small, and they still required 8 pins to be inserted into the mold, then removed before the mold could open. This just wasn't going to work, but the idea was getting more defined.

## Iteration 3

I began to look for different ways to make through-holes in products, I came across some manufacturing videos on injection molded plastic components.

To produce through holes in this manner is called "shutoffs". Essentially, the material, once injected, flows over the top of a single pillar, but not around the sides, and once that pillar is removed there is a perpendicular hole. This is exactly what I wanted to produce. This way the target would have perpendicular holes that allowed me to attach or remove a wire or elastic. I was a bit skeptical, this works for injection molded plastic, but how would I form these at home? I had to get creative...

There had to be a break point near the center of the target, to allow a large portion of the target to be free once it had hardened and i removed one half, but the shutoffs had to pass entirely through the mold. If they didnt, then there would be leakage and the perpendicular holes wouldnt form properly, so both halves needed to be modified to fit each other, while also have separate separation points.

The image above shows the bottom portion of the mold, which has these pillars that the material flows over the top, but not the sides.

The image above shows the top portion of the mold, which has holes that fit the shutoffs exactly and a little extra space over the top of the holes to allow material to flow over it.

And then - here we are. a real shutoff, too bad the material was ridiculously soft and the shutoffs are way too close to the strap connection points and they're also a little thin. also, look at those bubbles - I really need to find a way to get the air out of my mold.

![Iteration 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/vids/ezgif.com-gif-maker (9).gif)

Time to get back to designing, It was now time to address the bubbles and thickness of the shutoffs. Also, the last mold was ridiculously hard to separate, maybe there is some alternative way to gain leverage and separate them.

![Circle Mold Vents]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Circlemoldwventsbot.jpg)

The above image shows the bottom of the mold, it's definitely an improvement. the shutoffs contour the cosmetic dip in the front of the target, and they're much thicker now. it's almost exactly 12" in diameter, which makes purchasing a wire easier, there are some 45 degree holes on the backside, which allows the mold to be pulled apart with string (this didn't work the way i expected) - overall a solid improvement.

![Circle Mold Vents]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/Circlemoldwventstop.jpg)

The above image shows the top of the mold vent holes were added to the sides and vent holes were added to the tops of the shutoffs - that way i could use a syringe and inject material through those holes and really verify that there weren't as many holes where there needed to be structural stability for testing.

And now - the target is starting to look a lot better. The shutoffs are appropriately sized, only one of the shutoffs has a major air hole, and overall air flow improved. still though - there's room for improvement.

![Iteration 4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/vids/ezgif.com-gif-maker (8).gif)

It's time to fix this up - a big redesign began, altering the number of strapping holes created a more streamlined user workflow. 3 straps are all that are required to hold the target snugly to a fix point, so remove 5 holes, put them all in a line so that the user has clear indication of how to use and place the target. shutoffs are placed appropriately contouring the cosmetic divot, cosmetic divots were added to the outside of the target contouring its new shape and a full concentric circle was added to pay homage to the dartboard target style we all know and think of when you say "target".

The mold began to improve drastically, ejector pin holes were added to the bottom portion of the mold, and hand grips were added as well. That way, when the target is getting removed, I have something to hold onto and press into the table.
