I had recently taken a Coursera course on Aerial Robotics, so I was interested in getting something drone-related started. There are some awesome setups for micro quad copters out there. The instructions for most of them were clear, but the need for fasteners, and multiple parts seemed aggravating. I figured, I could design and print a single body to hold all of the components, so I did. 

I started out with these components:

[Micro Scisky 32bit Microcontroller](https://www.banggood.com/Micro-Scisky-32bits-Brushed-Flight-Control-Board-Built-in-FlySky-Compatible-RX-For-DIY-Micro-Frame-p-1093312.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

[3.7V 500mAh Battery x2]()

[Brushed DC Motors (2 packs of 2)](https://www.banggood.com/2-X-8x20mm-Motor-For-Hubsan-X4-H107C-H107D-RC-Quadcopter-p-87683.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

[Ladybird Propellors (1 pack of 4)](https://www.banggood.com/Wholesale-3-Set-Walkera-QR-Ladybird-Spare-Parts-Main-Blades-Propellers-QR-Ladybird-Z-01-p-47127.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

[Battery Charger](https://www.banggood.com/X6-6-In-1-Charger-For-Hubsan-X4-WLtoys-UDI-JXD-JJRC-Syma-JXD-p-965757.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

[FlySky FS-i6 2.4G RC Transmitter](https://www.banggood.com/FlySky-FS-i6-2_4G-6CH-AFHDS-RC-Transmitter-With-FS-iA6B-Receiver-p-983537.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=CN)

I also purchased the following components (although they weren't used until iteration 3):

## Iteration 1

In the beginning I wanted to create a solid body that held the 32 bit Micro SciSky controller and all four of the 8.5mm Motors. Once I was comfortable with the base, I knew I would add in the other component slots (battery and camera). I created the base to have an open bottom and rubber band straps, so that no tape was needed.

## Iteration 3

Iteration 3 was the beginning of the end for the project.
