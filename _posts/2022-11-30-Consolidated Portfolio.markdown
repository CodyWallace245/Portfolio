## Design and Production of TIR Targets

![Full Assembly]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/TIR Targets/IMG_1515.jpg)

What : Design a sports target that can withstand ~100N of instantaneous force applied at the center, is easily setup, and provides feedback to the user

Why : Current sports targets are difficult to setup, break easily and don't provide enough feedback to the user.

How : Used Fusion 360 to design the product and sample molds, contacted and worked with Chinese manufacturers to produce molds, samples and production batches.

Results : The design fulfilled its purpose and >2000 products have been shipped to the US.

## Designing a Chess Set
![Iteration 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/ChessSetGold.jpg)

What : Design a Chess Set that is unique to my design style and that would be usable at a professional chess tournament, and printable on DM studio system.

Why : I wanted to create something unique that I could share with my employer and allow them to safely create marketing material around it.

How : Used Fusion 360 to design each set piece. Each piece was printed, polished, and coated.

Results : The design was sucessful, marketing material was and still is made to show off both the design and the manufacturing process.

## Design of a 3D-printed Hexapod

 ![Iteration 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Final_Render.png)

What : Design a robot that can be 3D printed and used to explore small locations that otherwise wouldnt be reachable by humans.

Why : Our final project at WPI was our choice and we wanted to do something that pushed our current design capabilities.

How : We designed our hexapod and periferals in Solidworks, printed the parts on a Makerbot 3D printer and assembled a working hexapod.

Results : We completed our project and won the 2015 Mechanical Engineering Provost award - the highest award a project can earn at WPI.

## Designing a 8.5mm motor Micro Quadcopter

![Iteration 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Copter_ Body_V3.PNG)

What : Design a print in place Quadcopter body that required only 1 rubber band to fully assemble.

Why : To test my design skills and fully understand how a quadcopter operates and is built.

How : Designed in Fusion 360, printed on monoprice select and purchased components from Banggood website. Assembly and programming was done at home.

Results : Quadcopter was able to fly appropriately for 5 minutes at a time (limited by battery life).
