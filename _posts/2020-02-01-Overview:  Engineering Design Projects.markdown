## Covid Swabber
Designed at the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak in collaboration with other designers and doctors through email to help provide concepts for potential additive manufacturing solutions to aid in rapid covid testing. This concept was altered slightly and used by Formlabs to mass manufacture covid swabs.

## Generative Bike Saddle

The Bike saddle was part of 1 day competition at Desktop Metal to generate designs that would be 3D printable and usable on a bike. Because the saddle would be made from metal, the overall thickness could be reduced to roughly 3mm and it would reduce overall weight and provide structural stability. Personally - I'd like my bike seat to have cushion though.

## Printhead Jig
Designed to aid in printhead assembly and repair. A Desktop Metal Studio printer head fits inside and a simple dowel or 2mm hex wrench can be used to secure the head. This allowed the person assembling or repairing to easily hold the print head squarely and in place which working on it.
