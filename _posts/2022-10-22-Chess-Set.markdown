Designing a Chess Set has been one of my goals for a long time. I've tried a bunch of different design variations to finally come to a very classical looking chess set.
While designing a chess set isn't directly rooted in engineering, it really requires a lot of design work. Most pieces are easily rotated after they've been designed, but the knight is the quite unique.

Each piece has to be within a certain scale of the others, if they aren't it looks strange. If you've ever played chess with very unique pieces, you know that after 10 turns it gets a little difficult to determine which piece is which. This same thing can happen with pieces that are not scaled properly, a pawn can easily look like a bishop from the top-down view.

Fortunately, there are some guidelines provided by FIDE on regulation chess pieces.

The heights were really useful in determining scale, but the bases should really be the same size to create a cohesive look and feel.

## Iteration 1
![Iteration 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/Chess Set/Early Knight Piece.jpg)
The earliest version of the pieces referenced Doric greek architecture - pillars surrounded the base and flat lines gave a very chiseled look to the pieces. This was great in concept, but the issue was weighting. Metal 3D printing has limitations, and overhangs like the horses jaw were not going to work well. The support structure would be resting on a steep incline and as the part sintered the support structure would fall out leaving a broken jaw. Unfortunately, this wouldnt be the best solution.

## Iteration 2

The second version of the knight was trying to dial back the complexity of the part, beacuse as each piece gets more complex it needs to fit in style to the other pieces, a complex version of the knight meant a more complex version of the pawn, king, queen, bishop and rook. Unfortunately this was way too simple, this didnt display my ability to design in any way and it really didnt make for a compelling chess set.

## Iteration 3

I started to revamp my strategy - I knew I could design the knight, but the commonality between each piece was the base. A solid good looking base could then be adjusted to each piece and because I was using metal 3D printing, I could create designs that would otherwise never be created. This base concept referenced Voroni structures, while still being printable. Two layers of trapezoidal pillars were created and then rotated to different degrees to create a base structure that displayed a parallax when rotated. This was great in concept but extremely difficult to print.

## Iteration 4

I reviewed my previous work and returned to a more classical thematic look. Medieval walls were the theme that influenced this design, the jagged edges and rigid structure could make for strong pieces, but in the end, the weight and overbearing amount of base took away from the identity of the piece. This was getting closer.

## Iteration 5

This set was simple and elegant, which started to become my ideal theme. Draped cloth was the identity of these pieces, sharp corners and unique identifiers created a beautiful chess set. The base of the part became unobtrusive and just created a plate for each piece to display its own beauty I really was proud of this one and we created the pieces. Unfortunately, It was plagued again. The knights jaw was too far forward and broke in sintering, the rim of the rook was too sharp, the ball on the bishops hat was too small and the kings crown was to intricate to make it through the process. If I was working with SLS or DLM these pieces would be beautiful.
